# Idleon Active Assistant

Idleon Active Assistant is a tool for the popular idle game Legends of Idleon.

**It is not a hack.** This tool was designed to help do some tasks easier by automating mouse moving and clicking in most cases. Carpel tunnel can have a real impact on gamers, and this was also an inspiration for designing the tool.

If you have any suggestions or issues, feel free to post in the issues tab. Thanks!
